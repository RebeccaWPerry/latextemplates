WriteLaTeX is a really good platform independent LaTeX tool. The downside is that you have to pay to have private documents up there. It would be very reasonable to want to keep your scientific research or homework assignments private. In this case, you may decide that you want to write LaTeX documents locally on your own computer (which is actually the more typical workflow for writing LaTeX). This will require you to install something. Here are some suggestions for different operating systems:

There are a lot of online LaTeX equation type setters. 
<a href="http://hostmath.com/"</a>hostmath.com </a> is one of my favorites. It is geared towards typesetting equations for inclusion in web pages, but you can always take a screenshot to include it in a paper or presentation.
