This is how you might start typing a paper. If you wanted to add equations, you 
would need to include other packages in the preamble. This document is set to 
double spacing and 12 pt font in the preamble. Try switching to 1.5 spacing or 
changing the font size.

The margins in the article class are automatically a little wide for my taste, 
so I used the fullpage package. You can also set the margins to a specific size 
using the geometry package that is commented out (\%) above instead of the fullpage
package. The default margins are set to have 60-70 
characters per line for optimum readability, but your teacher might think you are 
just trying to increase your page count by having large margins.
